 <p>Clay is compose by dirt and water. elements that contain life within. 
   Every element is able to absorb any form or intention that it's projected to. 
   Water particles change their shape depending on how it is speaking. 
   If you gently tell the whater I love you it will create beautiful patterns, if its told I hate you the particles 
   will transform their shapes into broken patterns. I focus my intention on creating piece that has been absorb 
   the proper energy to have them be created into shapes and forms with the intention on becoming transfer divices. 
   the straight lines are intented to help deliver the messages in a direct way.
