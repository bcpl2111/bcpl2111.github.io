 <p>Clay is compose by dirt and water. elements that contain life within. <br>
   Every element is able to absorb any form or intention that it's projected to. <br>
   Water particles change their shape depending on how it is speaking. <br>
   If you gently tell the whater I love you it will create beautiful patterns, if its told I hate you the particles <br>
   will transform their shapes into broken patterns. I focus my intention on creating piece that has been absorb <br>
   the proper energy to have them be created into shapes and forms with the intention on becoming transfer divices. <br>
   the straight lines are intented to help deliver the messages in a direct way.<br>
